# Converting Video to GIF

This program can be used to simply to convert a .mp4 file to a .gif file using moviepy package
The program isn't as detail but just a mini-project/application which might be helpful

The logic is to basically shrink the file by reducing the FPS i.e. Frames Per Second and make the file smaller, which makes the vid or gif to be slower, which is the reason why the file size is reduced drastically...
